Here’s an updated version of the README based on the "Autonomous3DPathfinder" project name:
Autonomous3DPathfinder

Autonomous3DPathfinder is a reinforcement learning-based agent designed to navigate a 3D maze environment and find the optimal path from a start position to a goal while avoiding dynamic obstacles. The agent uses Q-learning to improve its decision-making over multiple episodes. It incorporates real-world challenges, such as moving obstacles, to mimic realistic pathfinding problems.
Features

    3D Maze Navigation: The agent can navigate a 3D grid (layers, rows, columns) to find the shortest path to the goal.
    Dynamic Obstacles: Obstacles in the environment move randomly at set intervals, adding complexity to the pathfinding challenge.
    Q-Learning: The agent uses Q-learning to update its action-value function and improve its performance over time.
    Epsilon-Greedy Policy: The agent explores the environment randomly with a probability (epsilon) to ensure effective exploration and exploitation.
    Optimal Path Finding: After training, the agent can find the best path from start to goal based on its learned Q-table.

Installation

To get started with Autonomous3DPathfinder, you need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies. You can do so by following the steps below.

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Autonomous3DPathfinder.git
cd Autonomous3DPathfinder

Install the necessary dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Dependencies

Autonomous3DPathfinder requires the following Python packages:

    numpy
    matplotlib
    random

Install all dependencies using the provided requirements.txt:

numpy==1.24.0
matplotlib==3.7.1

Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the program and train the agent to navigate through the 3D maze.

    Run the agent and start training:

    python main.py

    After training, the agent will find the optimal path, and the results will be displayed in a 3D plot, showing the path taken by the agent and the locations of dynamic obstacles.

Training the Agent

Training the agent involves running the Q-learning algorithm for a specified number of episodes. During training, the agent will:

    Start from the initial state.
    Take actions based on the epsilon-greedy policy.
    Receive rewards based on its interactions with the environment.
    Update its Q-table after each action.

The agent will continue training for a set number of episodes or until it reaches the goal.
Visualizing the Path

After the agent completes training, the optimal path is visualized using matplotlib in a 3D plot, which helps you understand how the agent navigated through the maze while avoiding obstacles.
